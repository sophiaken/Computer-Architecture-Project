Project description:
Utilized CPU and GPU in google collab to measure the performance of SVM and Neural networks using multithreading in Python.


Instructions:
1)All programs must be executed with python 3.5 or above.
2) Google colab is the platform that we used for GPU and CPU. Executing the programs in that environment will be accurate for results.
3)For GPU, the google colab notebook settings has to be changed from None to GPU in order to run the GPU code in the colab environment.
4)Tensor flow packages and scikit libraries has to be installed in the Google colab for execution of programs.
